\***\*Backend Learning Sandbox (Multi-App Backend Learning Project)\*\***

A personal backend engineering sandbox for building multiple real-world applications inside a single Node.js + TypeScript codebase.

**_🚀 Overview_**

This project started as a small practice environment to learn and implement authentication in Node.js, but it quickly evolved into something bigger.

I realized that to truly grow as a backend engineer, I needed to build multiple types of applications, explore different architectural patterns, work with several databases, and handle real-world backend problems.

So this repository is now a multi-application backend playground, containing different backend applications such as:

1. 📝 Blog App
2. 🛒 E-commerce App
3. 💬 Chat App
4. 🧠 Quiz App
5. 🗒️ Notes App
6. 🏥 Health-Care App

More apps coming as I explore new concepts…

This project is designed as a continuous learning journey — not a finished product.
Anyone is welcome to explore the code, open issues, submit PRs, or simply give feedback.
I’m building this to become a better backend developer, and feedback is always appreciated.

**_🎯 Goals of This Project_**

-Gain deep backend development skills using Node.js + TypeScript
-Learn authentication & authorization (JWT, sessions, access/refresh tokens)
-Practice multi-module backend architecture in one codebase
-Explore multiple databases (MongoDB first, PostgreSQL later)
-Learn proper API design, error handling, and clean code practices

Work with real-world backend patterns such as:
-Controllers & Services
-Middleware pipelines
-Reusable utilities
-Config-driven environments
-Route modularization

Build production-ready backend components that can scale across apps

**_🏗️ Technologies Used_**
Core Stack:

-Node.js
-Express.js v5
-TypeScript
-MongoDB (Mongoose)
-PostgreSQL (coming soon)

- **About the Hospital**: Learn about **Life Care Hospital**, its services, and its mission to provide top-quality healthcare.

## Pages and Functionalities

1. **Home**:
   - Provides a general overview of the services offered by **Life Care Hospital** and quick access to key actions like booking appointments, sending messages, and more.

2. **Register**:
   - Patients can create a new account by entering their personal details, including name, email, and password, to gain access to the patient portal.

3. **Login**:
   - Patients can log in using their registered email and password to access their dashboard and manage their interactions with the hospital.

4. **Appointment Booking**:
   - Patients can book appointments by providing their personal details, selecting the doctor they wish to meet with, and choosing a suitable date. Appointments are then reviewed by the hospital admin.

5. **Messages**:

6. **About Us**:
   - Patients can view detailed information about **Life Care Hospital**, its history, and its mission to provide exceptional healthcare services to the community.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend Framework**: React.js
- **State Management**: React Hooks and Context API
- **API Calls**: Axios for making HTTP requests to the backend

## Getting Started

To run the Patient Portal of the Hospital Management System locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system
- Backend server for handling API requests (ensure that the backend is running)

### Installation

 1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Fairooz2150/Hospital-Management-System.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the Frontend-Patient folder:

  ```bash
cd Frontend-Patient
  ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to **http://localhost:5173** to access the Patient Portal.

### Environment Variables

Ensure that you have a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variable:

```bash
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

This will allow the frontend to communicate with the backend server.

### Usage

1. Register as a patient by filling out the registration form with your personal information.
2. Log in to access the patient dashboard where you can manage appointments and send messages to the hospital.
3. Book appointments with doctors by providing necessary details, selecting a doctor, and choosing a preferred appointment date.
4. Send messages to the hospital administration for any queries or concerns.

### Contributing
